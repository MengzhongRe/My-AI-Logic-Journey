## 📖 Introduction (项目简介)

Welcome to my engineering portfolio. I am a **Master's student in Logic at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU)**, exploring the intersection of **Formal Logic (Symbolic AI)** and **Deep Learning (Connectionist AI)**.

This repository documents my journey from a logic scholar to an AI Algorithm Engineer. It contains reproduction of classic papers, fine-tuning experiments, and engineering implementations of LLM applications.

**Goal:** To build AI systems that not only "generate" but "reason".

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (技术栈)

*   **Core:** Python, PyTorch, CUDA
*   **NLP:** Hugging Face (Transformers, Datasets, PEFT), LangChain
*   **Infrastructure:** WSL2, Git, Linux
*   **Theory:** Transformer Architecture, Self-Attention, Propositional/Modal Logic

## 🚀 Roadmap & Progress (两年的征途)

- [x] **Phase 1: The Foundation (Day 1)**
    - [x] Environment Setup (WSL2 + 5070Ti + CUDA)
    - [x] Hand-written Self-Attention Mechanism
    - [x] Fine-tuning BERT on `ChnSentiCorp` (Accuracy > 90%)
    - [x] Engineering: Building CLI Inference Tools
- [ ] **Phase 2: LLM & Instruction Tuning**
    - [ ] Llama-3 / Qwen deployment
    - [ ] LoRA / P-Tuning implementation
- [ ] **Phase 3: Logic-Augmented AI**
    - [ ] Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
    - [ ] RAG with Logical Knowledge Base
